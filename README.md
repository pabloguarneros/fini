# Trying to Understand Finance
This project is a personal attempt to understand the material covered in MITx's MicroMasters Program on Finance.
Rather than acting as a normal Python library, it is meant as material to learn more about finance. Each folder will have particular calculations as well as explanation of some of the concepts / assumptions made.

The repo is divided subjectively. Its organization will improve as I progress through the course. I am a small chicken exploring finance, so beware of taking this library seriously.
